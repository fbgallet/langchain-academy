# LangChain Academy - Introduction to LangGraph - TypeScript UNOFFICIAL version

This is a TypeScript port of the original Python implementation of the excellent Introduction to LangGraph step-by-step tutorial. It's my personal, unofficial port of the original code. Only the code in the `module-n\studio` folder, intended to be launched with LangGraph Studio, is concerned. I have not ported the Jupyter notebooks. In the original Python version, some notebooks were not reproduced as an agent in the studio folder. In such cases, I generally created a corresponding agent in the `module-n\studio` folder.

ðŸš§ This is a work in progress ! Currently, only module 1 and the beginning of module 2 have been ported to TypeScript. ðŸš§

## Introduction

Welcome to LangChain Academy!
This is a growing set of modules focused on foundational concepts within the LangChain ecosystem.
Module 0 is basic setup and Modules 1 - 4 focus on LangGraph, progressively adding more advanced themes.
In each module folder, you'll see a set of notebooks. A LangChain Academy accompanies each notebook
to guide you through the topic. Each module also has a `studio` subdirectory, with a set of relevant
graphs that we will explore using the LangGraph API and Studio.

### Set OpenAI API key

- If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can sign up [here](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment

### Sign up and Set LangSmith API

- Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://smith.langchain.com/), find out more about LangSmith
- and how to use it within your workflow [here](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), and relevant library [docs](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)!
- Set `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` in your environment

### Set up Tavily API for web search

- Tavily Search API is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG, aimed at efficient,
  quick, and persistent search results.
- You can sign up for an API key [here](https://tavily.com/).
  It's easy to sign up and offers a very generous free tier. Some lessons (in Module 4) will use Tavily.

- Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in your environment.

### Set up LangGraph Studio

- Currently, Studio only has macOS support and needs Docker Desktop running.
- Download the latest `.dmg` file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download)
- Install Docker desktop for Mac [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Running Studio

Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the `module-x/studio/` folders.

- To use Studio, you will need to create a .env file with the relevant API keys
- Run this from the command line to create these files for module 1 to 4, as an example:

```
$ for i in {1..4}; do
  cp module-$i/studio/.env.example module-$i/studio/.env
  echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=\"$OPENAI_API_KEY\"" > module-$i/studio/.env
done
$ echo "TAVILY_API_KEY=\"$TAVILY_API_KEY\"" >> module-4/studio/.env
```
